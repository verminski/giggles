… They will finally feel the flames
Flames that run down through my veins
I will make this city burn
We're not planning to return

… Trying so hard to be free
To make you see what I see
Hold on to your wishes
If you can't hold on to me

… Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now

… Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now

… Oh, my love (let you down)
Oh, my love (oh, let you down)
Love (let you down)
(Oh, let you down)

… Oh, let you down
Oh, let you down
Let you down
Oh, let you down
